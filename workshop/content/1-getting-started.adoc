= Getting started

During this lab we will spend some time getting familiar with the aspects of OpenShift that are relevant to virtual machines, create a virtual machine, import a virtual machine, and configure a containerized application to use a VM-hosted application component.

[IMPORTANT]
**If, at any time, you have a question or issue please do not hesitate to get the attention of a lab proctor to assist.**

== The lab environment

This lab environment utilizes the Bookbag interface for presenting an interactive lab guide. **We recommend that you open the OpenShift console in a separate browser window.** Afterward, adjust the sizing to feel appropriate so that you can see the lab guide and the console at the same time.

While progressing through the lab, you'll be able to _copy_ commands to be used in the terminal on the right of this window. The commands to be copied will be indicated using the copy symbol: <span class="fas fa-copy"></span>.

```copy
oc get node
```

If, when copying the value, you need to first edit the value before being used, this will be indicated using the user edit symbol: <span class="fas fa-user-edit"></span>.

```copy-and-edit
oc get node node-name-goes-here
```

Clicking on the displayed value will again copy it into the clipboard and you can then paste it to the required location. Before the value is used though, you should make any changes as instructed. How you paste a value into the terminal/UI will depend on the operating system and browser being used. For macOS you should be able to use `<Command-v>`. On Linux and Windows, try `<Ctrl-v>` or `<Ctrl-Shift-v>`.

If at any time a glitch occurs and the workshop content does not display properly because of a network issue, and so an error is displayed, or it shows as a white page, select the drop-down menu at the top right corner, above the terminals and select "**Reload Workshop**". That menu item will reload just the workshop content and leave you on the same page.

Where possible, don't refresh the browser window as you will be reverted back to the welcome page (it will not remove any progress that you've made) - you will need to navigate back to where you were. If you have any issues which using the reload menu items do not solve, please ask for help!

== The OpenShift Console

The OpenShift console is the primary GUI-based interface used by administrators and developers to access, manage, and configure the resources deployed to OpenShift.

To login to the console:

* Open [this link](https://link_goes_here), or copy/paste this url: https://link_goes_here, in a new tab or window
* Use the credentials below
